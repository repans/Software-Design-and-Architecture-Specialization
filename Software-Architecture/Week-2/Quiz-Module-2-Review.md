# Module 2 Review 
 

### 01. If you have a program language that is largely procedural, which architecture style are you likely to use?

- [ ] Pipe and Filter 
- [ ] Process Control
- [x] Main Program and Subroutine
- [ ] Event Based 


### 02. What are some disadvantages of Data-Centric Architecture? Select the 2 correct answers.

- [x] The existing data schema is difficult to change. 
- [ ] Considerable overhead for data transfer between data accessors.
- [x] The system becomes heavily reliant on the central data.
- [ ] Data integrity can be compromised by having it widely accessible. 


### 03. Which of these principles is NOT characteristic of a layered system?

- [ ] abstraction 
- [ ] separation of concerns
- [ ] sandboxing 
- [x] tight coupling


### 04. Which of the following is a common messaging pattern in client/server relationships?

- [ ] handshake 
- [x] request-response 
- [ ] one-way 
- [ ] solicit-response 


### 05. How does an n-Tier architecture differ from a layered architecture?

- [ ] Layered architectures are more loosely coupled
- [x] The interaction between tiers in an n-Tier architecture is strictly message based
- [ ] A layered architecture is limited to three layers, whereas an n-tier can go to as many as are needed
- [ ] n-Tier architectures are only found on the Internet 


### 06. Which of these is NOT a possible use for Interpreters?

- [x] Enhancing resource usage efficiency 
- [ ] Giving end users the opportunity to program scripts or macros
- [ ] Allowing developers to develop add-ons in a common language 
- [ ] Abstracting away platform details


### 07. Which of these is an advantage of event-based architecture?

- [ ] Events are processed with more efficiency 
- [ ] All interactions happen synchronously
- [x] Event generators and event consumers are loosely coupled 
- [ ] Events trigger responses in a predictable manner 


### 08. There is a common technique that is used in event architectures to indicate whether or not a particular resource is being accessed by another process at that moment. What is it called?

- [ ] occupied 
- [x] semaphore 
- [ ] toggle 
- [ ] access switch 


### 09. Beverly is asked to develop a way to control a process. There is a device to measure the height of liquid in a tank, and when the tank is almost full, a pump turns on to empty the tank. Which type of process control architecture will she use?

- [x] Feedback Loop
- [ ] Open Loop
- [ ] Feedforward Loop
- [ ] Shooting Control


### 10. What are the steps in complex, process control system architectures, such as self-driving cars?

- [ ] read, plan, deliver
- [ ] analyze, model, plan, act
- [x] monitor, analyze, plan, execute
- [ ] sense, interpret, model, act 


### 11. Which of these applications would be best suited to a procedural programming paradigm, such as the Main Program and Subroutine architecture?

- [ ] Accessing data from a repository 
- [ ] A user interface, such as a simple poker game 
- [x] Analyzing data and producing reports
- [ ] A self-driving car


### 12. Which of these is NOT an advantage of pipe and filter architectures?

- [ ] Complex transformations can be broken down into subtasks 
- [ ] Filters can be reused 
- [x] Data transformation is computationally efficient 
- [ ] Filters are loosely coupled
